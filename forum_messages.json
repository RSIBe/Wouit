Last season, I used futures for the first time to hedge about 30% of my crop. When the market unexpectedly turned, I managed to secure a much better price than the spot market. It was a learning curve, but well worth it. Happy to share more about my approach if anyone's interested !", "timestamp": "2024-02-02 09:30:13"}, {"name": "Farmer 78", "message": "Hi everyone, it's Mia from Montana.\nThis year's been tough with the drought affecting almost 40% of my yield. \nI hadn't locked in futures as I should have, and now I'm facing lower prices. \nAny advice on damage control? \nAre there short-term strategies in futures that can help mitigate this kind of loss?", "timestamp": "2024-02-02 09:31:24"}, {"name": "ColoradoSofia", "message": "Greetings, Sofia from Colorado.\n I've been thinking, given our collective knowledge and experiences, why not form a buying group?
